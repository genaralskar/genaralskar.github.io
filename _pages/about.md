I like making video games! I've been playing them ever since I was a kid and always thought it would be cool to make them too! When I went to college at Utah Valley University I got my first taste of it and fell in love.
I always hated school, but for the first time I was actually sad if I had to miss a class. I've learned so much and made so many fantastic friends since then, 
and I'm excited for whatever new opportunities come my way.

While video games are all well and fun, I've got a few other hobbies I enjoy as well. I like to make music; I like to use synths and stuff to make electronic music but I can also play the ukulele, can sort of play the piano, and I used to play the violin way back in middle school (I'm probably not very good anymore). I also like to DM for Dungeons & Dragons; I'm still pretty new at it, but I've always enjoyed making stories and worlds and characters and stuff but never really had a way to express them until now. When I started playing D&D I immediately wanted to start DMing, and since I have it's been a lot of fun.

I've got a lot of experience making games in Unity from design, to coding, to modeling and animating, to materials, shaders, lighting, and lots of stuff inbetween
I enjoy using Houdini as well, creating tools and procedural builders for things is something I find fun. I guess it's kinda like a puzzle, finding what goes where to get to the next step.
