This puppy has been a long time coming. This the culmination of about a year and half of work for a senior project for school. A lot has gone into it, and man am I glad to be over.
<br>For this project I was technical lead, did most of the coding, made most of the toon shader stuff, put the Unity project together, and did various other things.
<br>There was a lot originally planned that had to be cut. The biggest was probably the ability to chose a variety of vehicles and different armor to go with them.
It's still a possibility if we want to work on this more down the road, but that probably won't happen.

You were originally going to be able to choose what vehicle to drive, and what armor it would have. We had to cut it to finish the project in time, but all the cars and at least one set of armor for them did get modeled<br>

An early proof of concept to show the driving/general look of the game. This was before we switched to a better car controller, so the driving isn't as good in this<br>

An early version of the intro sequence before we added all the pretty stuff to the level. This was only a week or two before the release version. It's suprising how much changed in that short period
