A small collection of some shaders I've made. These were all created with Unity's Shader Graph


#### Toon
This is a basic toon shader I built for a proof of concept for the Crimson Sands game. It uses (or I was at least trying to use) a dither for the shadow and highlights. You can see it pretty clearly with the highlights.

And here it is on a charger modeled by [Caboose](https://sketchfab.com/caboosereynolds)

#### Crystals
This was a combination of a lot of the stuff below. The little floaty bits in the crystal are slightly parallaxed, iridescent, and slightly scrolling. There is some emmission intensity being animated, as well as one of the crystals having a bit of refraction going on.

#### Parallax
This one was inspired by some of the shaders in the Dreaming City in Destiny 2. There are some panels that have like space charts that go super "deep."

#### Iridescence
I wanted some iridescence on the crystals, so I first had to figure out how to make that happen. I belive I took the dot product of the normals and the camera view, then used those values to drive a rainbow gradient. I added the two spheres at the top because they kinda look like eyes.<sub>I always feel like, somebody's watching me</sub>

#### Color Nonsense
I was just messing around with blending... textures I think, together and seeing what happens. There's some vertex offset in there as well that follows a circle that move out from the center. Lots of blending, scrolling, and polar coordinates. A lot of my substance designer experience came in handy here.

#### Fake Interior
I wanted to put this at the bottom because I'm not entirely sure how it works. I followed a twitter post I wish I could find, I'll link to it if I do. It takes a cube map, in this case from a reflection probe, so the interior is actually a model in the scene instead of an exported image.

I noticed if I set the shader to instanced vs not it would put the windows in object space or world space. Another interesting effect, is if the plane gets scaled in the "depth" direction, the effect is more pronounced
