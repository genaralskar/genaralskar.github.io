I was laying in bed half-awake one morning, and a thought puts into my head. "That'd be a fun game," I thought to myself. So then I made it. That game was One Bullet! You shoot one bullet, that then splits into two bullets, and each of those split into two bullets, and so on and so forth. You just gotta survive as long as possible!

## Development
It was a simple concept, so it was pretty easy to make. I made it in about two days, one day for the game part, another to juice it up! Development was pretty smooth, not too much to talk about comes to mind. The game is actually 3d, just top down and orthographic, I just like working with the 3D stuff better than 2D, and it's a small enough game on a browser so I figured it wouldn't matter anyway.  
I had a hard time finding a good song, so eventually I settled on a whole album. It just pick a random song to play each time, which I'm glad I did because it helps keeps each play interesting and you don't go crazy listening to the same song over and over.  
All the coding behaved pretty well. The biggest issue was when I didn't assign something properly and it just spawned over 7000 balls in a few seconds. That was fun.

## Conclusion
All and all, I'm happy with how it turned out. An idea I had one morning turned into an actual thing two days later. It's nice to just have something finished and know you actually *can* finish something. So many of my projects end up as prototypes or are left half done. Having small projects like this are really nice and help my motivation to finish other stuff. Now I just need to finish something bigger haha.
